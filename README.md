# Description
This is a simple card matching game where the goal is to select a pair of cards that are "matching". Cards are all hidden, and only visible when you select a card. 
Only 2 cards are visible at most at once. This adds memory component to this game.

What makes this game different from the rest is what it means for cards to be "matching".
On the cards is Arabic text, which you have to match to make a pair. 
However the text can use any form of the letter, so a person needs to be able to recognize and match different forms of the same letter.
<br>
Easy only deals with single letters, where one of the cards is the isolated form of the letter and the pair is another form.

In higher difficulties, there are words, for which the pair is a string of the same letters but with spaces and in their isolated form.
